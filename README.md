## Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format.
- Explored and applied relevant transformations, such as log scaling on the 'Close' column.

## Data Analysis

- **Time Series Plot:** Reveals a descending trend from 2014 to 2015, followed by a significant and sustained upward trend from 2015 onwards. Periods of increased volatility are observed in 2014 and 2017.
