#  Overview

This project involves the analysis and visualization of Bitcoin price data. Key objectives include exploring trends over time, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the behavior of Bitcoin prices.

## Dataset

The dataset(1556 rows Ã— 7 columns) comprises Bitcoin price information, including open, high, low, close values, volume, and market cap, spanning from April 28, 2013, to July 31, 2017.

## Technologies Used
The analysis was performed using Python, leveraging the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

## Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format.
- Explored and applied relevant transformations, such as log scaling on the 'Close' column.

## Data Analysis

- **Time Series Plot:** Reveals a descending trend from 2014 to 2015, followed by a significant and sustained upward trend from 2015 onwards. Periods of increased volatility are observed in 2014 and 2017.

- **Handling Object Data:**
   - Set the 'Date' column as the index of the DataFrame.
   - Explored and visualized the 'Close' column.
   - Applied log scaling to the 'Close' column for better visualization.
